## What it does

Flint lives in your menubar and opens in under a second via a global hotkey. Every tool runs **100% on-device** — no network, no account, no subscription. Paste from the clipboard and Flint auto-detects the likely tool.

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap chutiponh/flint
brew install --cask flint
```

If Homebrew asks you to trust the tap, run `brew trust chutiponh/flint` and install again. The cask strips the quarantine flag on install, so the app opens without a Gatekeeper prompt.

### Manual (DMG)

Download the latest `Flint-x.y.z.dmg` from [**Releases**](../../releases), open it, and drag **Flint** to Applications.

> **First launch:** This build is not notarized by Apple, so macOS shows an "unverified developer" warning. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway**. You only do this once.
>
> Terminal alternative: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Flint.app`

## Build from source

Requires **Xcode 16.3+** and **macOS 14.0+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chutiponh/flint.git
cd flint
open Flint.xcodeproj    # then ⌘R
```

Or build a distributable DMG:

```bash
bash scripts/release-free.sh    # unsigned/ad-hoc DMG → dist/
```

Maintainers with an Apple Developer account can produce a signed + notarized DMG with `scripts/release.sh` (see `DISTRIBUTION.md`).

## Tech

SwiftUI + MVVM · `MenuBarExtra` · GRDB (history) · KeyboardShortcuts (global hotkey) · swift-markdown · CryptoKit. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the full stack rationale.

## Sponsor

Flint is free and offline-first. If it saves you time, consider [**sponsoring**](https://github.com/sponsors/chutiponh).

**First goal — $99/year:** fund Apple Developer Program enrollment so releases can be **signed + notarized**. That removes the "unverified developer" warning on install and re-enables in-app auto-update.
