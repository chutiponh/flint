# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-25)

**Core value:** A developer can paste content and get the right transformation in under a second — fully offline, from anywhere on the system, never crashing on bad input.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — extended-tools

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (extended-tools) — EXECUTING
Plan: 6 of 7
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-26

Progress: [█████████░] 88%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Use GRDB 7.11.1 (not SwiftData — has critical macOS 14 bugs) for history SQLite store
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Use KeyboardShortcuts 3.0.1 (not CGEventTap — triggers Accessibility permission dialog)
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Use HighlightSwift 1.1.0 (Highlightr is deprecated) and swift-markdown 0.8.0 (Ink lacks GFM)
- [Pre-Phase 1]: ToolDefinition/ToolRegistry abstraction must be frozen before any tool work begins
- [Pre-Phase 1]: History must exclude HMAC keys and JWT secrets by schema design from day one
- [Pre-Phase 1]: JSON Formatter is the first tool — integration test proving the full pipeline before remaining 6 tools
- [Phase ?]: SHA-256 test vector corrected during execution — verified via shell sha256sum (not from memory)
- [Phase ?]: CRC32 via import zlib — uLong/Bytef/crc32() require explicit zlib module not Foundation
- [Phase ?]: Hash HMAC secret-exclusion: View-local @State in HashView, transient method param only — mirrors JWT pattern from 01-03 (INFRA-09)
- [Phase ?]: WindowCoordinator activation dance for macOS 14 (openSettings broken with .accessory)
- [Phase ?]: Task 3 a11y: automated checks pass; live VoiceOver/Light-Dark deferred to pre-release
- [Phase 01 Plan 07]: Task 4 perf checkpoint accepted on source-level architecture checks only; cold start / hotkey latency / RAM / idle CPU measurements are unmeasured and deferred to a pre-release Instruments pass — architecture structurally supports the budget but numbers are unconfirmed
- [Phase 01 Plan 08]: Use plain VStack + .onTapGesture instead of Button so .onDrag can claim the press gesture (macOS Button pre-empts drag); add .accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton) to preserve role
- [Phase 01 Plan 08]: Remove destIndex+1 in PinnedToolDropDelegate.performDrop — Array.move toOffset is already insert-before-index convention; the +1 double-compensated and placed forward drags one slot past the drop target
- [Phase ?]: Use NSTextViewDelegate doCommandBy in SyntaxEditorView.Coordinator for Esc intercept, posts .escapePressed notification; no debounce needed because editor-focused and unfocused paths are mutually exclusive
- [Phase ?]: OKLCH reverse (sRGB→OKLCH) hand-computed via CSS Color L4 Oklab inverse matrix chain — ChromaKit has no reverse API
- [Phase ?]: Color gamut detection via own unclamped sRGB range check — ChromaKit clamps silently; own check + WarningBannerView (D-08)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- UUID v7 package choice unresolved (nthState/UUIDV7 vs leodabus/UUIDv7) — evaluate at Phase 1 sprint start; move UUID-02 to Phase 2 if vetting takes more than half a day
- MenuBarExtraAccess vs NSStatusItem decision deferred — start with MenuBarExtra + MenuBarExtraAccess; escalate only if programmatic control needs exceed what it provides

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Tools | JSONPath query tab (V2-TOOL-04) | v2 | Requirements phase |
| Tools | JSON-vs-JSON semantic diff (V2-TOOL-05) | v2 | Requirements phase |
| Tools | UUID v7 (UUID-02) | Phase 1 or 2 depending on package vetting | Research phase |
| Distribution | App Store sandboxed build (V2-DIST-01) | v2 | Requirements phase |
