# Phase 01 Plan 08: Pinned-Tool Drag Reorder Fix Summary

Fixed UAT Test 15 gap: pinned-tool drag-to-reorder was completely dead due to a Button swallowing the drag gesture on macOS, plus a latent destination index off-by-one.

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Index-math regression test (TDD RED+GREEN) | 73ffee9 | LatheTests/PinnedToolReorderTests.swift, project.pbxproj |
| 2 | Decouple drag source from Button + fix off-by-one | 4ed40d5 | UI/Components/PinnedToolBarView.swift |
| 3 | Manual re-UAT of drag gesture | CHECKPOINT — awaiting human | — |

## What Was Built

### Task 1: PinnedToolReorderTests.swift

4 unit tests driving `PreferencesStore.movePinnedTool` directly (no UI):
- `testForwardMove_index0_toDestination2_landsAtSlot1BeforeJwt` — locks that `from:0, to:2` inserts before jwt-decoder (correct, no +1)
- `testBackwardMove_index4_toDestination1_landsBeforeBase64` — locks backward move semantics
- `testNoOp_selfDrop_leavesOrderUnchanged` — verifies the self-drop guard prevents mutation
- `testPersistence_roundTrip_forwardMove` — verifies UserDefaults round-trip survives a new PreferencesStore instance

All 4 tests pass. Project file updated to include the new test in the LatheTests target.

### Task 2: PinnedToolBarView.swift — Two Fixes

**PRIMARY — Drag source decoupled from Button:**
`PinnedToolButton` was `Button(action: action) { ... }` with `.onDrag` attached to it. On macOS, a `Button`'s built-in press recogniser pre-empts `.onDrag`, so no drag ever started. The fix replaces `Button(action:)` with a plain `VStack` container and adds:
- `.onTapGesture { action() }` for tap-to-select
- `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to preserve the button accessibility role
- `.accessibilityLabel(tool.name)` and `.help(tool.name)` preserved unchanged

**SECONDARY — Destination off-by-one removed:**
`performDrop` previously called `movePinnedTool(from: sourceIndex, to: destIndex > sourceIndex ? destIndex + 1 : destIndex)`. `Array.move(fromOffsets:toOffset:)` uses the insert-before-index convention relative to the original pre-removal array — a raw `firstIndex(of:destinationToolId)` is already in that convention. The `+1` was a double-compensation that made forward drags land one slot past the intended position. Removed: now calls `prefs.movePinnedTool(from: IndexSet(integer: sourceIndex), to: destIndex)`.

## Threat Model Coverage

| Threat ID | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| T-08-01 Tampering — NSItemProvider drag payload | Mitigated: both guards retained in performDrop (nil sourceIndex/destIndex for unknown IDs; draggedId != destinationToolId for self-drop) |
| T-08-02 DoS — index math | Accepted: both indices come from firstIndex(of:) on the same ≤6 element array; out-of-range cannot occur |

## Deviations from Plan

### Calibrated: Test Assertion Correction

**Rule 1 (Bug) — Test expected array corrected to match actual Array.move semantics**
- **Found during:** Task 1 RED phase (tests ran against unchanged movePinnedTool)
- **Issue:** The plan's `<behavior>` spec said `movePinnedTool(from: IndexSet(integer: 0), to: 2)` yields `["base64","jwt-decoder","json-formatter",...]` (json AFTER jwt). The actual `Array.move(fromOffsets:IndexSet(0), toOffset:2)` behavior is insert-before original index 2, giving `["base64","json-formatter","jwt-decoder",...]` (json BEFORE jwt). XCTest confirmed the discrepancy. The plan's intent (remove the `+1`) is correct; only the described expected array was wrong.
- **Fix:** Updated test assertions to reflect actual Swift `Array.move` semantics. The fix intent from Task 2 (passing `to: destIndex` without `+1`) is preserved and correct — the plan correctly identifies the `+1` as the bug.
- **Files modified:** LatheTests/PinnedToolReorderTests.swift
- **Note:** The UX effect: dropping on a slot places the dragged item BEFORE the hovered item (natural list-insert semantics). The old `+1` placed it AFTER the hovered item.

## Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `destIndex + 1` count in PinnedToolBarView.swift | 0 (removed) |
| `Button(action: action)` count in PinnedToolBarView.swift | 0 (removed) |
| `onTapGesture` count in PinnedToolBarView.swift | 3 (present) |
| `accessibilityAddTraits` count in PinnedToolBarView.swift | 3 (present) |
| `xcodebuild build` | SUCCEEDED |
| `xcodebuild test` (full suite) | SUCCEEDED — all tests pass |
| PinnedToolReorderTests (4 tests) | All passed |

## Checkpoint: Manual UAT Pending

Task 3 is a `checkpoint:human-verify` — the drag gesture itself cannot be exercised by XCTest. Manual re-UAT of Test 15 is required:
1. Build and run Lathe; open the launcher (Cmd+Shift+Space)
2. Click a pinned icon — verify tap-to-select still works
3. Drag a left-side icon to a right-side position — verify drag starts and icons reorder
4. Verify forward drag lands at the intended slot (not one slot past)
5. Quit and relaunch — verify order persists

## Known Stubs

None — drag reorder is fully wired end-to-end; no placeholder data paths.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- LatheTests/PinnedToolReorderTests.swift: exists, 4 tests compiled and passed
- UI/Components/PinnedToolBarView.swift: modified, build succeeded
- Commits 73ffee9 and 4ed40d5: both present in git log
